[00:08.09] I got this feeling inside my bones
[00:13.06] It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
[00:16.02] All through my city, all through my home
[00:21.03] We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
[00:45.03] 
[00:24.05] I got that sunshine in my pocket
[00:27.00] Got that good song in my feet
[00:29.01] I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[00:33.04] I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[00:38.00] You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop
[01:01.50] 
[00:41.04] Under the lights when everything goes
[00:46.02] Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[00:50.07] When we move, well, you already know
[00:55.01] So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
[00:59.03] Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[01:04.02] Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[01:07.03] So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:08.01] All those things I should do to you
[01:10.04] But you dance, dance, dance
[01:12.08] And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[01:35.08] 
[01:16.00] I can't stop the feeling
[01:18.08] So just dance, dance, dance
[01:20.08] I can't stop the feeling
[01:22.05] So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:40.05] 
[01:25.04] Ooh, it's something magical
[01:28.09] It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
[01:33.04] I don't need no reason, don't need control
[01:37.01] I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
[02:00.01] 
[01:41.09] Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
[01:44.05] Got that good song in my feet
[01:46.02] I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[01:50.02] I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[01:54.04] You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop
[02:17.54] 
[01:58.08] Under the lights when everything goes
[02:02.04] Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[02:07.08] When we move, well, you already know
[02:10.04] So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
[02:15.04] Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[02:20.09] Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[02:23.09] So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[02:24.05] All those things I should do to you
