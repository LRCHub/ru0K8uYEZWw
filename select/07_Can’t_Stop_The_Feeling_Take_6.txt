I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, ooh-ah

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance (come on now)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance

Ooh, it's something magical (ooh magical)
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance (baby)
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance (come on now)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance

Oh, I've got to dance, woh-oh
Feel like dancing
Oh, I've got to dance, woh-oh
Feel like dancing
Oh, I've got to dance, woh-oh
Feel like dancing
Oh, I've got to dance
'Cause everybody feels like dancing

Dance form your heart
And you will feel better
So much better
Can you feel people
So keep on dancing
Keep on dancing, yeah

Wait, what?
Can we take a breather?
Nope

So dance on this feeling
Move to the floor
Dance away your troubles
We won't be back for more
So dance when you feel it
And leave it if you don't
Dance baby, dance baby
(I've got this feeling, just dance, dance, ooh oh)
(I've got this feeling, just dance, dance, ooh oh)
(I've got this feeling, just dance, dance, ooh oh)
(I've got this feeling, just dance, dance)
Dance baby, dance baby
